# A second look at LetsVPN Apps from Third-party and non-App store locations

## Key Findings

* Investigated 8 LetsVPN clones

* Two of the APKs are msi files, two are "exe" files, and the remaining are APKs files

* One is for the legitimate App, X use obfuscation (shared/imported libraries still contain social network of Code)


## Motivation & Background

LetsVPN is an app focused primarily on Chinese users. [Crybl](https://cyble.com/blog/new-malware-campaign-targets-letsvpn-users/) 
documented attackers targeting LetsVpn to install malware on the user's device. The legit LetsVPN App is developed by LetsGo Networks and
is geared towards Chinese users. This makes it an appealing backdoor target. I identified 7 imposters by manually enumerating different
random, one character transformations of the domain name "letsgovpn" letsgovpn.com. and modifying the extension

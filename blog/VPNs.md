# Overview

In this article I will be discussing how I conducted open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering
for various VPN products. This project was motiviated because VPNs are increasingly popular with at-risk
communities and regular people. There are too many VPNs for any one person to audit, and so we need a
way of assessing whether people should trust them or not. A good component when making these decisions 
is understanding whether the provider operates transparently.  While there are some good reasons
why the VPN provider should not be identified, having this information allows potential users to 
better judge for themselves whether the provider can be trusted with their data.

The first step in this analysis is building a list of VPNs to investigate.



# VPN Analysis

The following sections will cover my methodology while vetting VPNs. I will tell you how
I evaluated each VPN and what information about the VPN I used to decided whether it
should be included in the final analysis list or not. Each section is dedicated to
a single VPN provider.

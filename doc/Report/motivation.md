`RQ1: Is owner, operator, developer transparency is important?`
`RQ2: Why owner, operator, developer transparency is important?`
`RQ3: How can lack of ood trans negatively impact users?`

Transparency is an important factor when people consider which VPNs they use. Typically transparency 
is considered from the perspective of how a company use data it collects from its users. Another element
of transparency less often considered but equally important is owner, operator, and developer transparency.
Many of the other VPN rating systems do not consider the transparency practices associated with the VPN
developer, business owner, and operator, and this can be a serious problem. The i-Recording app was 
deployed by a small developer named [Lavabird Ltd.](https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/data-stealing-malware-discovered-in.html)
and installed a malicious update to the app that violated user privacy.

| On February 12, Malwarebytes said that Lavabird blamed an account named "the space team" for the changes following a purchase deal in which the app's ownership would change hands. Lavabird purchased Barcode Scanner on November 23, and the subsequent space team deal was agreed on November 25. While the research team has been unable to contact "the space team," Lavabird told Malwarebytes on February 10 that they were "outraged no less," and Lavabird only acted as an "intermediary" between "the seller and the buyer in this situation."  

# Personal Notes

1. What impact has lack of transparency in VPNs or other applications had on users?

Does framing this as an open question have as much meaning or actually motivate users to care
or take transparency seriously? My initial thinking is no. It seems like users need things
to be very simple which is fine and understandable, but we need a good example have
how a lack of transparency has had a substantive impact on user privacy and/or security.
